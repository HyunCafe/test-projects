    <a><p class="Quote">Peanut butter-filled crackers dipped in chocolate and decorated with candy sprinkles are a decadent treat to have on hand. Store cookies between layers of waxed paper in cool, dry place, or in the refrigerator. These freeze well</p></a>

        <!-- Ingredients -->
<a class="Ingredients"><ul><h2>Gingersnap Cookie Ingredients</h2>
      <li>¾ cup creamy or chunky peanut butter</li>
      <li>2 pounds chocolate almond bark, broken into pieces</li>
      <li>80 buttery round crackers <em>(such as Ritz®)</em></li>
      <li>2 ¼ ounces colored candy sprinkles <em>(Optional)</em></li>
</ul></a>

        <!-- Directions -->
<a class="Directions">   <ol><h2> Directions </h2>
     <li>Spread approximately 1 teaspoon peanut butter onto each cracker half. Press peanut butter sides together to form 40 peanut butter-filled sandwich cookies.</li>
     <li>Melt almond bark in the top of a double boiler over hot, but not boiling, water. Reduce heat and keep melted chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water.</li>
     <li>Dip each sandwich cookie into the melted chocolate, allowing excess to drain back into pot.</li>
     <li>Place coated cookies onto waxed paper and immediately sprinkle with candy sprinkles so they adhere to the melted chocolate.</li>
     <li>Place cookies in the refrigerator until chocolate has set, about 15 minutes.</li>
